CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

 

Plaintiffs PHILIP W. TIPPETT and INGRID TIPPETT, on behalf of themselves and all
others similarly situated, sue Defendant WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A., successor by merger to
WELLS FARGO FINANCIAL BANK, (“Wells Fargo” or “Defendant”), on the grounds set forth
below.

L INTRODUCTION

1. Wells Fargo has a reputation for its deceptive lending practices. In the last decade
alone, consumers and regulators have pursued claims against Wells Fargo for a variety of illegal
tactics, including opening unnecessary or unauthorized accounts on customers’ behalves;
unilaterally modifying the repayment terms of borrowers’ home loans; reducing customer credit
limits and freezing lines of credit without justification; bundling or “adding on” products such as
car and pet insurance to customer accounts without full disclosure; artificially inflating the

amounts charged consumers for force-placed insurance; and falsifying borrowers’ income
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 2 of 16 PagelD 2

documents to facilitate their approval for loans they were not, in fact, qualified to receive.! Wells
Fargo has made a practice of gaming the system to its advantage, reaping exorbitant and illegal
profits at their clients’ expense.

2. Plaintiffs in this case, and the class of Wells Fargo borrowers they seek to represent,
are victims of Wells Fargo’s pattern of misconduct. Specifically, at the time they obtained
purchase-money financing from Wells Fargo for their new home, Plaintiffs and the Class members
entered into an EquityLine with FlexAbility Agreement (also referred to herein as the “EquityLine
Agreement”) with Wells Fargo, pursuant to which they were given access to a revolving line of
credit secured by second mortgages on their homes.”

3. Because these HELOC loans are secured by second mortgage liens on borrowers’
homes, it was crucial that the liens terminate after the final maturity date for the loans—the date
on which the borrowers must repay the outstanding balances in full. Otherwise, if Wells Fargo’s
security interests in the properties terminated before the borrowers had repaid their debt, the
balance of the debts due and owing would be unsecured, thus exposing Wells Fargo to an increased

risk of nonpayment across the entire product line.

? These loans are commonly known as home equity line of credit loans and will be referred to
herein as “HELOC loans” and the mortgage securing such loans as the “HELOC mortgages.”

4, Wells Fargo mishandled this important detail by including in its HELOC mortgages
earlier maturity dates for the HELOC loans that did not reflect the terms of the EquityLine
Agreements. This, in turn, caused the liens of the HELOC mortgages to terminate prior to the
maturity dates of the HELOC loans.

5. Upon realizing its mistake, and unwilling to expose itself to the risk of holding
potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in unsecured debt, Wells Fargo undertook to change the
terms of its HELOC mortgages fraudulently and without notice to its borrowers. Instead of
informing their customers of their mistake, Wells Fargo unilaterally recorded instruments entitled
“Affidavit of Correction” in the counties where its borrowers resided, purporting to “correct” the
maturity dates of the HELOC loans as stated on the HELOC mortgages. Wells Fargo executed and
recorded the Affidavits of Correction without notifying borrowers, thus clouding the titles to their
properties and reducing the properties’ value and marketability without borrowers’ knowledge.
The Affidavits of Correction were fraudulent instruments, and subject Wells Fargo to criminal
liability in every state where the lender recorded them.’

6. Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of a proposed nationwide class of borrowers
who obtained HELOC loans from Wells Fargo and who had fraudulent Affidavits of Correction
recorded which purported to change the terms of their HELOC mortgages. Plaintiffs seek
declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 on behalf of themselves and the class adjudging
the Affidavits of Correction to be void and of no effect. Plaintiffs also seek relief pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2202 enjoining Wells Fargo from recording Affidavits of Correction in the future.

7. Plaintiffs also bring this case on behalf of a subclass of Florida residents in order to

seek injunctive relief for Wells Fargo’s violations of section 817.535(8), Florida Statutes.
Il. PARTIES

8. Plaintiffs Philip W. Tippett and Ingrid Tippett are residents and citizens of the State

of Florida. The Tippetts own the following described real property located in Marion County:
Lot 69, Block A, Silver Springs Forest, according to the Plat thereof
recorded in Plat Book F, Page 80, Public Records of Marion County,
Florida.

9. Wells Fargo is a federally chartered bank with its principal place of business in San
Francisco, California. Wells Fargo provides personal and commercial banking services and is the
principal subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company, a multifaceted financial service company.

10. In 1998, Wells Fargo & Company merged with Norwest Corporation, another
banking and financial services company, which owned Dial Bank, a state bank organized and
existing under the laws of South Dakota. At that time, Dial Bank was one of the top consumer
finance firms in the country, and was among the many such firms with its principal place of
business in South Dakota, because that state was the first to deregulate its consumer credit
marketplace and allow credit card issuers to charge unlimited interest rates to consumers.
Following the Wells Fargo/Norwest merger, Dial Bank changed its name to Wells Fargo Financial
Bank and began marketing its deregulated consumer credit products to Wells Fargo’s customer’s
nationwide from the deregulated environment in South Dakota.

11. In 2009, Wells Fargo Financial Bank merged with Wells Fargo Bank, National

Association, which is now known as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 5 of 16 PagelD 5

IW. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness
Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), because Plaintiffs are citizens of Florida and Defendant is a citizen of
California; there are one hundred or more class members, many of whom citizens of states other
than those where Defendant is a citizen; and the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds
$5,000,000.

13. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Wells Fargo pursuant to Florida Statutes

§ 48.193(1)(a)(1), (2), and (6) because Wells Fargo conducts substantial business in this judicial
district and a substantial portion of the actions giving rise to the claims took place in this judicial
district. Further, Florida has significant contacts with Wells Fargo as there are more than 500
Wells Fargo branches in Florida.

14. Venue is proper in the Middle District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)
and (3) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred, and a
substantial part of the property that is subject of this action is situated, in this district.

IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

15. Wells Fargo provides revolving lines of credit to consumers, including HELOC
loans, which it often offers in conjunction with providing purchase-money financing of consumers’
homes. In many cases, Wells Fargo offers these loans to consumers without explaining their
purpose or terms, and absent any initiating request by the borrower for such a loan.

16. Wells Fargo’s HELOC loans were extended pursuant to the terms of an agreement
titled “EquityLine with FlexAbility Agreement” which provided for 10-year draw periods during
which borrowers could take cash advances up to certain credit line limits followed by repayment

periods of either 15 years or 30 years depending on the amount of the loan balances at the end of

1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 6 of 16 PagelD 6

the draw periods. These advances were secured by second mortgages or deeds of trust—the
HELOC mortgages—which created liens on the borrowers’ properties in favor of Wells Fargo.

17. | Because these HELOC loans are secured by second mortgage liens on borrowers’
homes, it was crucial that the liens terminate after the final maturity date for the loans—the dates
on which the borrowers must repay the outstanding balances in full. Otherwise, if Wells Fargo’s
security interests in the properties terminated before the borrowers had repaid their debt, the
balance of the debt due and owing would be unsecured. This would expose Wells Fargo to an
increased risk of nonpayment across its portfolio of loans of this kind.

18. Wells Fargo mishandled this important detail by including in its HELOC mortgages
earlier maturity dates for the HELOC loans that did not reflect the terms of the EquityLine
Agreements. This mistake caused the liens of the HELOC mortgages to terminate prior to the
maturity dates of the HELOC loans.

19. Upon realizing its error, and unwilling to expose itself to the risk of holding
potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in unsecured debt, Wells Fargo undertook to change the
terms of its HELOC mortgages fraudulently and without notice to its borrowers. Instead of
contacting their customers, explaining their error, and securing authorization to fix the issue
through the correct means, Wells Fargo surreptitiously and unilaterally recorded instruments
entitled “Affidavit of Correction” in the counties where its borrowers resided, purporting to
“correct” the maturity date of the HELOC loans as stated on the HELOC mortgages. Wells Fargo
executed and recorded the Affidavits of Correction without notifying borrowers, obtaining
borrowers approvals, or providing any consideration to the borrowers for the unilateral reformation
of the mortgage agreements, thus clouding the titles to their properties and reducing the properties’

value and marketability without borrowers’ knowledge.

1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 7 of 16 PagelD 7

20. The Affidavits of Correction were fraudulent instruments, and subject Wells Fargo

to criminal liability in every state where the lender recorded them.
Plaintiffs Philip and Ingrid Tippett

21. Plaintiffs Philip and Ingrid Tippett purchased a home in Ocala, Florida, in October
of 2003, with a $100,000 first mortgage from Wells Fargo.

22. Before executing their loan documents, the Tippetts’ loan officer at Wells Fargo
advised them that they would not need to make an out-of-pocket down payment on the home if
they also applied for a $25,000 HELOC loan. The HELOC loan carried an interest rate of 15.569%,
while the Tippetts’ first mortgage carried an interest rate of 7.2602%.

23. On October 9, 2003, the Tippetts executed three separate agreements: a first
mortgage, an EquityLine Agreement, and a HELOC mortgage. The Tippetts’ first mortgage,
EquityLine Agreement, and HELOC mortgage are attached as Exhibits A, B, and C, respectively.*

24. Pursuant to the terms of the EquityLine Agreement, the draw period on the
Tippetts’ HELOC loan ended on October 9, 2013, and the repayment period for the loan would
continue until a maturity date of either on October 9, 2028, if the unpaid balance on the loan was
less than $20,000 at the end of the draw period, or October 9, 2043, if the unpaid balance exceeded
that amount.

25. On April 2, 2013, approximately six months before the maturity date of the
EquityLine Agreement and without Plaintiffs’ knowledge, Wells Fargo executed an Affidavit of
Correction, which purported to “correct” the maturity date of its secured interest in the Tippetts’

property, changing it from October 25, 2013 to October 9, 2043.

 

4 The HELOC agreement includes a limited arbitration clause. As such, the Tippetts pursue only
equitable claims outside the arbitration clause’s reach.

7
1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 8 of 16 PagelD 8

26. Wells Fargo recorded the Affidavit of Correction with the Clerk of Court in Marion
County, Florida on April 4, 2013. A copy of the Tippett Affidavit of Correction is attached as
Exhibit D.

27. The Affidavit of Correction is still reflected in the chain of title for the Tippett
Plaintiffs’ property in Marion County; as such, the title to their property remains under cloud, and
they have been harmed.

28. As with all Class members, at no time prior to the execution of this Affidavit of
Correction, and at no time since that affidavit was recorded, did Wells Fargo or any of its agents
or assignees inform the Tippetts of Wells Fargo’s unilateral action.

29. Neither Wells Fargo nor any of its agents or assignees secured permission or
consent from the Tippetts to unilaterally and materially alter the terms of the mortgage contract.

30. The Tippetts received no consideration, monetary or otherwise, from Wells Fargo
or any other source as compensation for the unilateral changing of the terms of the mortgage to
their detriment.

31. There are no material differences between Wells Fargo’s actions and practices
directed to the Tippetts and those directed to the class.

V. TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
A. Discovery Rule Tolling

32. Because Wells Fargo had fraudulently and surreptitiously filed the Affidavits of
Correction regarding Plaintiffs’ and Class members’ properties, unilaterally and without their
authorization, Plaintiffs and the Class members did not have knowledge of facts that would have led
them to discover that their legal rights had been violated.

33. Thus, within the time period of any applicable statutes of limitation, Plaintiffs and

1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 9 of 16 PagelD 9

Class members could not have reasonably discovered that Wells Fargo had fraudulently and
unilaterally filed the Affidavits of Correction regarding their properties.

34. No reasonable person would have a reason to review whether Wells Fargo had
recorded any instruments, much less fraudulent instruments, regarding their properties.

35.  Forthese reasons, all applicable statutes of limitations have been tolled by operation
of the delayed discovery rule.

B. Fraudulent Concealment Tolling

36. All applicable statutes of limitation have also been tolled by Wells Fargo’s active
fraudulent concealment of its filing of the Affidavits of Correction.

37. Wells Fargo purposely filed the Affidavits of Correction without first seeking
consent of Plaintiffs and the Class members knowing that Plaintiffs would have no reason to
review or discover these filings.

38. Wells Fargo had a duty to disclose its filings and instead knowingly, affirmatively,
or actively concealed them.

39. | Because Wells Fargo actively concealed the fraudulent filing by failing to inform
or request the authorization from the homeowners, it is estopped from relying on any statutes of
limitations defense.

C. Estoppel

40. Wells Fargo was and is under a continuous duty to disclose to Plaintiffs and Class
members the filings of the Affidavits of Correction and the cloud it placed on the loans. Wells
Fargo actively concealed the filings and knowingly and purposefully failed to seek consent and

authorization from Plaintiffs and the Class members.

1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 10 of 16 PagelD 10

41. Plaintiffs and Class members reasonably relied upon Wells Fargo’s knowing and
active concealment and omission of material facts and therefore could not have reasonably
discovered the fraudulent filings. Thus, Wells Fargo is estopped from relying on any defense based
in statutes of limitations in this action.

VI. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

42. Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a Class action on behalf of themselves and all other
persons similarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(1)(A) and
(b)(2), on behalf of a class and subclass defined as follows:

Nationwide Class: All persons who opened a standard HELOC with Wells

Fargo, and for whom Wells Fargo recorded an Affidavit of Correction
purporting to extend the maturity date of its security interest in the subject

property.
Florida subclass: All persons who opened a standard HELOC with Wells
Fargo against a property in Florida, and for whom Wells Fargo recorded an
Affidavit of Correction purporting to extend the maturity date of its security
interest in the subject property.
43. Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify or amend the proposed class definitions before
the Court determines whether certification is appropriate.
44, The Class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a), as well as 23(b)(1)(A) and
(b)(2).
45, Numerosity. On information and belief, the Class consists of thousands of
geographically dispersed individuals, with hundreds of putative class members residing in Florida.
Joinder of the Class members is not practicable. The disposition of the claims of the Class members

in a single action will provide substantial benefits to all parties and to the Court. Further, the

individual Class members are ascertainable, as the names and addresses of all Class members can

10
1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 11 of 16 PagelD 11

be identified in the business records maintained by Wells Fargo. Notice of this action can thus be
provided to all members of the proposed Classes.

46. Typicality. Plaintiffs were mortgagors with Wells Fargo at the time of the
wrongdoing alleged herein, and Wells Fargo recorded fraudulent Affidavits of Correction against
their properties in effort to avert the termination of the lien of the HELOC mortgages. Plaintiffs’
claims are typical of the claims of all Class members, as all Class members are similarly affected
by Defendant’s wrongful conduct as complained of herein.

47. Adequacy. Plaintiffs are committed to prosecuting the action, will fairly and
adequately protect the interests of the members of the Classes, and have retained counsel
competent and experienced in class action litigation. Plaintiffs have no interests antagonistic to or
in conflict with other members of the Classes.

48. Commonality. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the
proposed Classes. The questions of law and fact common to the Classes include, but are not limited
to:

a. Whether the Affidavits of Correction filed by Wells Fargo are effective
to amend the terms of the class members’ HELOC mortgages;

b. Whether Wells Fargo provided notice to the class members prior to
filing the Affidavits of Correction;

c. Whether Wells Fargo had authorization to file the Affidavits of
Correction;

d. Whether authorization from the homeowners was required;

e. Whether the Affidavits of Correction created a cloud on the title of each
property for which one was recorded;

f. Whether in recording Affidavits of Correction in the State of Florida,
Wells Fargo violated section 817.535, Florida Statutes; and

g. Whether Plaintiff and the class members are entitled to relief and the
nature of such relief.

11
1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 12 of 16 PagelD 12

49, The Classes are certifiable under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) because the prosecution of
separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or
varying adjudications that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Wells Fargo.
Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief. If class members were to file multiple lawsuits in
multiple courts one court could declare the filing of the affidavits fraudulent and require injunctive
relief in the form of Wells Fargo withdrawing the affidavits, while another court could allow Wells
Fargo to continue its course of conduct and declare the affidavits lawful. Class treatment will also
avoid the substantial risk of inconsistent factual and legal determinations on the many issues in
this lawsuit.

50. The Class is certifiable under Rule 23(b)(2). Wells Fargo has acted or refused to
act on grounds that apply generally to the Class, so that final injunctive and declaratory relief is
appropriate respecting the Class as a whole.

51. There will be no unusual difficulty in the management of this action as a class
action. Rule 23 provides the Court with the authority and flexibility to maximize the efficiencies
and benefits of the class mechanism and reduce management challenges. The Court may, on
motion of Plaintiffs or on its own determination, certify nationwide and statewide classes for
claims sharing common legal questions; utilize the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) to certify
particular claims, issues, or common questions of law or of fact for class-wide adjudication; certify
and adjudicate bellwether class claims; and utilize Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(5) to divide any Class into

subclasses.

COUNTI
Declaratory Relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202

(as to All Class Members)

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporates paragraphs 1-42 above as if fully set forth herein, and

further alleges as follows.

52. Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, this Court may declare the rights and other

legal relations of the parties in dispute whether or not further relief is or could be sought.

53. An actual and bona fide controversy exists between the Plaintiffs, the Class
members and the Defendant as to the rights and obligations under the Affidavits of Correction.

54. Wells Fargo unilaterally executed and recorded Affidavits of Correction purporting
to correct a typographical error in the stated maturity dates in Plaintiffs’ and class members’
HELOC mortgages without the authorization of, or notice to, the Plaintiffs and Class members,
and without any legal authority to do so.

55. Plaintiffs and all class members are in doubt as to whether these Affidavits of
Correction effectively amend the terms of their HELOC mortgages and as to when lien of such
mortgage terminates.

56. Plaintiffs, on behalf of all class members, seek a declaration as to the legal effect,
if any, of the Affidavits of Correction that are the subject of this complaint.

57. The declaration sought with regard to the instant controversy is of a justiciable
nature, does not amount to an advisory decree and the adverse legal interests of the parties are of
sufficient immediacy and materiality to warrant a declaratory judgment.

58. Plaintiffs further seek an Order under 28 U.S.C. § 2202 requiring Wells Fargo to
withdraw each of the fraudulently filed Affidavits of Correction and enjoining Wells Fargo from

filing such Affidavits in the future.

13
1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 14 of 16 PagelD 14

59. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 permits the Court to determine the existence or
nonexistence of any right, duty, power, liability, privilege, or of any fact upon which the parties’
legal relations depend whether or not another adequate legal remedy exists

COUNT II
Violation of section 817,535(8), Florida Statutes (Injunctive Relief)
(as to the Florida Subclass)

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate paragraphs 1-42 above as if fully set forth herein, and
further allege as follows.

60. Section 817.535(8), Florida Statutes, authorizes “[a]ny person adversely affected
by an instrument filed in the official record which contains a materially false, fictitious, or
fraudulent statement or representation” to bring a civil cause of action.

61. The Affidavits of Correction at issue here represent that they are being filed to
correct a typographical error in the stated maturity dates in Plaintiffs’ and class members’ HELOC
mortgages. This representation is a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement as Wells
Fargo was without authority to unilaterally correct the stated maturity dates described herein.

62. Wells Fargo recorded the Affidavits of Correction without notice to Plaintiffs’ or
the class members, without their knowledge, and with the intent to defraud them.

63. Plaintiffs and the class members are adversely affected by the Affidavits of
Correction, and they impose unwarranted and illegal clouds on the titles to their properties.

64. Because the Affidavits of Correction are void ab initio, pursuant to section
817.535(8)(b)(1), Florida Statutes, Plaintiffs and the class members are entitled to an order, (1)
sealing the Affidavits of Correction from the official record and removing them from any
electronic database used for indexing or locating instruments in the official record; (2) enjoining

Wells Fargo from filing or directing the filing any instrument in the public record without prior

14
1205651
Case 5:20-cv-00342 Document 1 Filed 07/28/20 Page 15 of 16 PagelD 15

review and approval for filing by a circuit or county court judge; and (3) granting any other relief
the Court deems just and proper. (/d.).

65. Plaintiffs are also entitled to recover their costs and attorneys’ fees.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated individuals, demand judgment
against Defendant Wells Fargo as follows:

(1) Declaring this action to be a proper class action maintainable pursuant to Rule 23(a)
and Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and declaring Plaintiffs and their counsel
to be representatives of the Class;

(2) Declaring the Affidavits of Correction void as to Plaintiffs and all class members
and enjoining Wells Fargo from continuing the acts and practices described above;

(3) Finding that Wells Fargo violated section 817.535(8), Florida Statutes, by
recording the Affidavits of Correction in the State of Florida and enjoining it from further
violations of the statute;

(4) Ordering Wells Fargo to withdraw each of the fraudulently filed Affidavits of
Correction and enjoining Wells Fargo from filing such Affidavits in the future;

(5) Awarding all Plaintiffs and class members their attorneys’ fees and costs; and

(6) Awarding such other and further relief the Court deems just and equitable.

DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

Plaintiff demands trial by jury as to all issues so triable.
